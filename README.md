Raspberry Pi 3 - Candy tracker 

At a high level, 4 arcade buttons and 4 LED light strings were connected to a Raspberry Pi which activates and blinks the LED lights and updates a Google sheet to record which candy was selected and when it was selected. This data was shown as a bar chart on Google sheets (link below), which was shown on an iPad in the cabinet.

This was a halloween project I did with my kids to see what was the most popular trick-or-treat candy of the 4 they selected; KitKats, Sour Patch Kids, Twix or Nerds. We placed this cabinet, for lack of a better term, on a folding table in our driveway and placed a bowl of each of the corresponding candies in a bowl below each arrow. The trick-or-treaters would come up, push the button for their favorite, and take the candy from the bowl. For the build, we used a breadboard attached to a raspberry pi 3, a 8 terminal switch, led light strings for the "arrows", python code, and 5 arcade buttons. The lights for the arcade buttons ran off of a 9 volt battery. When you pressed the button it activated the switch attached to that particular candy's "arrow", and also updated a google sheets chart which was shown on an ipad in the cabinet. The red arcade button in the center activated a jumping spider that lept over the cabinet from behind. You probably have seen this spider decoration at a halloween store and we modified the activator to connect to this button rather than the intended pressure sensitive mat that you step on. We also printed a QR code so that, if people were interested in which candy won at the end of the night, they could take a picture of it and it would send them to the google sheet - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bcxbo76gJ1BeLx_HlNSxhXILO6CTZH6Sn2SP82E87RY/edit?usp=sharing

As you can see in the google sheet, we tracked the popularity of the candy, when it was chosen, number of trick-or-treaters within 5 minute intervals, and looked for trends. It was great to see the interest the kids had in this gadget and after 124 trick-or-treaters there was a clear preference for sour patch kids.
